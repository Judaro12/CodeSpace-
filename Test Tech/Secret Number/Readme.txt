Secret Number Game:

create a game were you have 3 tries to guess a number from 1 - 10, will display the tries left, information in higher or lower and as well if correct.


my thought process for the game:

- first i would like it to display all the buttons instead of a input form i would like it to be like a calculator

- build 3 display (1 for the remaining tries left) (2 for displaying if lower or higher)(3 to display the order number inputted )

- i would probably need around 3 variables - 1 to hold the data input from HTML - 2 to hold the times of tries - 3 to hold Math.random

- i would create a function to start the game and use Math.random

- will use almost the same idea as i did for the game of RPS
